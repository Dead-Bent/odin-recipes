Hey Zach, back at it again with another flashback. Today I'm going to be telling you what my current project is and what skills I'm using to do it. Its going to be a blast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First of all, the project is creating a basic recipe website with my gnarly html skills, such as: making paragraphs, placing images, inserting links, etc, etc, etc...

Second of all, well... that's pretty much it. Thanks for listening to my flashback Zach!
